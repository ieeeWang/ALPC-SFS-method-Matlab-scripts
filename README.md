# ALPC-SFS-method-Matlab-scripts
the Matlab scripts for the ALPC-SFS method proposed in our published paper on Scientific Reports:  

**Estimating multiple latencies in the auditory system from auditory steady-state responses on a single EEG channel**
The paper can be found [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-81232-5#additional-information).

Firstly, add the 'utilits' folder under the MATLAB path:
```
utilits_dir = 'your_own_foler_path\';
addpath(utilits_dir);
```

The three example simulations in this paper were generated by using the following scripts respectively:
```
ALPC_simulation_Example1.m 
ALPC_simulation_Example2.m
ALPC_simulation_Example3.m
```

A demo (Fig.4) of results of ALPC_simulation_Example1.m:
